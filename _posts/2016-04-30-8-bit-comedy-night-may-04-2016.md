[8-Bit Comedy Night - May 04, 2016][0]

8:00PM-10:00PM

Stand up comedy is like beer, some of the best is local. Why not enjoy both at 8-Bit Comedy at The Grid?

This wonderful month of May features...

Erick Biez

Hattie Jean Hayes

Steve Maxwell

Erin Ontko

Matt Storrs

Aaron Kyle Miles

Matt Micheletti

And as always your host,

Zed Phillips

It should go without saying, this is a comedy show at a bar so if you're expecting a family friendly experience, you are very strange for wanting to take your family to a bar on a Wednesday.

Otherwise, loosen up, enjoy the great beer and the great comedy!
