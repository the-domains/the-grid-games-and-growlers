Join us every 3rd Wednesday of the month for Artemis at The Grid!

Artemis is a Starship Bridge Simulator based on the Star Trek Universe. It's a mulitplayer cooperative game based on the different roles found on a starship: Helm, Tactical, Engineering, Science, Coms and Command.

While you're here beam yourself up to the bar for a 22oz Vulcan Ale or Romulanate (Romulanize?) any light colored beer at no charge!

For newbies we recommend the Unofficial Artemis Wiki:
